# isa-linalg (WIP)
C library for linear algebra operations. 
This is a single header-file library, and will have no dependencies outside of the standard library, so you ***only*** need the ***isa_linalg.h*** file to use it. 
Everything else in the repository is for development only and can be ignored.

It is written with resource-constrained systems in mind, so less memory use is a higher priority than performance.
Implementation for many functions are based off of ***libmatrix*** by ***Martin Brandt*** (https://gitlab.orbitntnu.com/selfiesat/obc_adcs/adcs/lib/libmatrix).

API documentation will be written later once the library's functionality has been fleshed out, profiled and tested to a degree where I am confident it is ready for a version 1.0 release.
