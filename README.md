# isa-linalg (WIP)
C library for linear algebra operations. 
It is written with resource constrained systems in mind, which is why it does not feature dynamic memory allocation. 

This is a single header-file library, so you only need the isa_linalg.h file to use it.
Everything else in the repository is for development and can be safely ignored.
API documentation will be written later once its functionality has been fleshed out.
