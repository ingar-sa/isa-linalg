# isa-linalg (WIP)
C library for linear algebra operations. 
This is a single header-file library, and will have no dependencies outside of the standard library, so you only need the ***isa_linalg.h*** file to use it. 
Everything else in the repository is for development only and can be safely ignored.

It is written with resource constrained systems in mind, which is why it does not feature dynamic memory allocation. 


API documentation will be written later once its functionality has been fleshed out.
